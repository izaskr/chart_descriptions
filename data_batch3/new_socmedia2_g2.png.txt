"\"The chart is titled The least frequent daily users of social media. We have data recorded in minutes rather than number of uses and results are split into responses for five age range groups; ages 15-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54 and 55-64. The scale for minutes is a little difficult to read with any accuracy due to the way it has been segmented but a rough idea of results can be found. Careful reading of the data shows that both the age group 25-34 and 35-44 recorded the same and overall lowest number of minutes at around 70 minutes each. The age group 45-54 recorded the highest number of minutes at around 150 per day.\""
