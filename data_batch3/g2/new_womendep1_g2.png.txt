"\"The chart is titled The most inclusive university departments given representation of women and depicts percentages across five departments. It is unclear whether the percentages refer directly to the proportion of women either working, studying or both in each department. The Literature department records the highest percentage of all departments at 70% with Mathematics having the lowest at 10%. Computer Science records 20%. Engineering 30% and Arts 60%.\""


"\"This chart shows the most inclusive university departments, in terms of their representation of women. The most inclusive is the Literature department at 70%, closely followed by the Arts department at 60%. Engineering department's representation of women is less than half at 30%, with computer science and mathematics department's the lowest, with 20% and 10% respectively.\""


"\"This chart shows that the mathematics department is the least inclusive with women making up only 10% of the department. on the other hand, the literature department boasts of 70% female population. engineering and computer sxience departments also have a low percentage of women in the workforce.\""


"\"The most inclusive university departments given representation of women were firstly literature (70% of females I'm assuming), followed by Arts (60%), followed by engineering (30%). The least inclusive were computer science (20%) and maths (10%).\""
