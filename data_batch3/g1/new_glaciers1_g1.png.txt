"\"This chart shows the number of expeditions that have explored a variety of glaciers. We can see that the most explored is Mefonna with 13 expeditions, and the least explored is Tasman.\\nThe data doesn't tell us much about the thoroughness, length of time spent per expedition, or the size of the expedition party. As such I don't think this chart is very useful in isolation.\""
