Second batch of data collection: 3 new scenarios, 3 old scenarios with new plots, 1 undecided
10 plots all together

First batch has 10 plots, 7 of these have % as units of the y axis, so we need to balance this


Scenario ideas for the second batch: 
- number of rockets launched to space per year in 4 years by USA
- age groups, social media usage, see https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2019/01/how-much-time-do-people-spend-social-media-infographic.html 
- stock value per weekday, see https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/msft 
- average age at first marriage (UK?) https://qz.com/1602272/the-average-age-for-marriage-in-the-uk-is-now-over-30/
- (downward trend) percentage fo U.S. adults who oppose same-sex marriage https://qz.com/1602272/the-average-age-for-marriage-in-the-uk-is-now-over-30/

- (intervals) No interest in politics by age https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-26271935
- (downward slope) age demographics  https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/30/most-common-age-among-us-racial-ethnic-groups/
- Religious Restrictionsworldwide https://www.pewforum.org/2019/07/15/a-closer-look-at-how-religious-restrictions-have-risen-around-the-world/


TODO:
- what scenarios from the first batch should we reuse
- properties of the first batch to spot imbalances

- Data showing downward trends
- Ordered data involving ranges/intervals (eg. years on x-axis)


CONSIDER:
- effects of large numbers (eg data involving millions and beyond)
