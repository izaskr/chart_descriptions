15 This graph shows that the median salary a software engineer increases as the level of their degree rises . Those with a PhD earn over $ 60 ,000 , about $ 10 ,000 per year more than those with a masters degree , who in turn earn about $ 10 ,000 per year more than those with a bachelor degree . Those with no degree earn the least at about $ 35 ,000 per year .

19 This chart displays the median salary per year of software engineers depending on their degree . Those with a PhD earn the most with 64 ,000 , then Masters at 54 ,000 , then Bachelor at 44 ,000 and those in the field with no degree earn 34 ,000 . This corresponds with what you would expect that those with a better education and more knowledge earn more
