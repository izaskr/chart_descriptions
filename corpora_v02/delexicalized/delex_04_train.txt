Those with XLEAST T0AY a YLABEL of YUNIT YLEASTAPPROX YMAG .
T1AB XLABEL XLABEL YLABEL	 T1AB who achieved a higher XLABEL of further education and higher XLABEL qualification earn a higher YLABEL .
XHIGHEST YLABEL BARSREST	 Those who have a XHIGHEST do better in terms of YLABEL than BARSREST
PLOTTITLE XHIGHEST YHIGHESTAPPROX YMAG XSECOND YSECONDAPPROX YMAG XTHIRD YTHIRDAPPROX YMAG XLEAST YLEASTAPPROX YMAG	 This chart displays the PLOTTITLE . Those with a XHIGHEST earn the most with YHIGHESTAPPROX YMAG , then XSECOND at YSECONDAPPROX YMAG , then XTHIRD at YTHIRDAPPROX YMAG and those in the field with XLEAST earn YLEASTAPPROX YMAG . This corresponds with what you would expect that those with a better education and more knowledge earn more
PLOTTITLE YUNIT ADDHIGHESTTHIRD YMAG YLABEL XTHIRD XLABEL XHIGHEST YUNIT ADDTHIRDLEAST YMAG XTHIRD XLEAST	 The graphs shows the PLOTTITLE . We can see that there is an approximately YUNIT ADDHIGHESTTHIRD YMAG YLABEL difference between those with a XTHIRD XLABEL and those with a XHIGHEST but only an approximate YUNIT ADDTHIRDLEAST YMAG difference between those with a XTHIRD and those XLEAST .

Those with a XHIGHEST earn over YUNIT YHIGHESTAPPROX YMAG , about YUNIT ADDHIGHESTSECOND YMAG T1AY more than those with a XSECOND XLABEL , who in turn earn about YUNIT ADDSECONDTHIRD YMAG T1AY more than those with a XTHIRD XLABEL . Those with XLEAST earn the least at about YUNIT YLEAST YMAG T1AY .
T1AB YLABEL XLEAST MULLEASTHIGHEST YLABEL XHIGHEST	 This graph shows a trend that the higher the qualifications held by T1AB , the greater the YLABEL they receive . Those with XLEAST receive almost MULLEASTHIGHEST of the YLABEL received by those with a XHIGHEST . Education increases earning potential .

XHIGHEST XLABEL T1AB ADDHIGHESTTHIRD YMAG XLEAST XTHIRD XSECOND ADDSECONDHIGHEST YMAG XHIGHEST XLABEL YLABEL	 The chart shows that with a XHIGHEST XLABEL T1AB earn the highest with over ADDHIGHESTTHIRD YMAG more than XLEAST and XTHIRD . XSECOND is only ADDSECONDHIGHEST YMAG behind XHIGHEST but shows more XLABEL are needed for higher YLABEL .
XTHIRD XSECOND XHIGHEST XLABEL XLEAST	 Students who have completed XTHIRD , XSECOND and XHIGHEST XLABEL earn significantly more than those with XLEAST .
PLOTTITLE T0AB XHIGHEST XLABEL XSECOND XTHIRD XLEAST	 This graph shows the PLOTTITLE . T0AB holding XHIGHEST XLABEL earn the highest , followed by XSECOND , then XTHIRD and finally XLEAST .

Those with XLEAST are the lowest at YLEAST YMAG , those with a XTHIRD XLABEL come in at YTHIRD YMAG . With a XSECOND XLABEL , the T1AB T1AY YLABEL is at YSECOND YMAG and finally , those with a XHIGHEST are at the highest level of YHIGHEST YMAG .
