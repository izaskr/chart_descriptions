In XSECOND it lowered to YSECOND YUNIT , in XTHIRD it hit just above YTHIRDAPPROX YUNIT . In XFOURTH it hit YFOURTH , and in XLEAST it hit YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT .

PLOTTITLE XSTART XSECOND XEND XFOURTH YSECOND XSECOND YFOURTH XFOURTH YHIGHEST YUNIT GRHIGHESTSECOND YLEAST XLEAST XFOURTH	 The PLOTTITLE XSTART XSECOND XEND XFOURTH is demonstrated here . It shows there to be little change over time , with YSECOND in XSECOND and YFOURTH in XFOURTH . There was however an increase to YHIGHEST YUNIT GRHIGHESTSECOND and a steady decrease to YLEAST in XLEAST . This decrease started to reverse in XFOURTH .

In XHIGHEST there was YHIGHEST YUNIT . This decreased by MULSECONDHIGHEST YUNIT by XSECOND and then there was a massive drop of MULTHIRDSECOND YUNIT in XTHIRD . In XFOURTH the YLABEL decreased by ADDFOURTHTHIRD and then in XLEAST there was a further MULLEASTFOURTH YUNIT drop . \\n It is clear from the chart the YLABEL have decreased INTERVAL and XSTART XHIGHEST XEND XLEAST there was a MULLEASTHIGHEST YUNIT decrease .
