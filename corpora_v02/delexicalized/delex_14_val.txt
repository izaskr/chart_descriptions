XHIGHEST , almost YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT of the T1AB were T1AY . This dropped to YSECOND YUNIT XSECOND ; YTHIRDAPPROX YUNIT XTHIRD ; YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT XFOURTH ; YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT XLEAST ; but rose to YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT XFIFTH .
YLABEL T1AB INTERVAL XLABEL YLABEL YHIGHEST YUNIT XHIGHEST T1AY	 THis shows the YLABEL in T1AB has steadily increased over INTERVAL XLABEL . Despite this increase , the YLABEL are still low with only YHIGHEST YUNIT of parliament XHIGHEST being a T1AY .

From the chart , we see that around XLEAST , we saw the YLABEL in the T1AB at around YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT , followed by YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT in the XLABEL of XFIFTH . We then saw a huge increase around XFOURTH with YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT and then around YTHIRD YUNIT in XTHIRD . We then saw an increase again in XSECOND with YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT which was followed by YHIGHEST YUNIT in XHIGHEST .
