PLOTTITLE YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT T1AY T1AX XLEAST YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT XHIGHEST YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT XSECOND T1AY T1AX XHIGHEST XLEAST	 This chart shows the PLOTTITLE . \\n There is a YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT chance that T1AY is T1AX by XLEAST , YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT XHIGHEST and YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT XSECOND . Overall T1AY is commonly T1AX by XHIGHEST , whilst XLEAST does not really have a greater effect .
PLOTTITLE XLABEL XHIGHEST YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT XSECOND YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT XLEAST YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT	 PLOTTITLE . Main XLABEL is XHIGHEST at YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT . Then XSECOND at YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT , finally XLEAST at YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT .
PLOTTITLE YLABEL XHIGHEST YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT XSECOND YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT XLEAST YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT	 This graph shows the findings of PLOTTITLE . \\n \\n The highest YLABEL was XHIGHEST at YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT . Next highest was XSECOND at around YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT and XLEAST the lowest , at just under YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT .
COUNT XLABEL T1AB XLABEL XHIGHEST YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT XLABEL YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT XLEAST	 This chart indicates COUNT possible XLABEL in the T1AB . It indicates the main XLABEL was attributed to XHIGHEST with YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT of the sample identifying that as the main XLABEL . Only YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT indicated XLEAST contributed to the problem .
XHIGHEST XLABEL YHIGHEST YUNIT XLEAST YLEAST YUNIT XSECOND YSECOND YUNIT XLABEL	 XHIGHEST is the major XLABEL at YHIGHEST YUNIT with XLEAST at YLEAST YUNIT but XSECOND is YSECOND YUNIT of leading XLABEL .
YHIGHEST YUNIT YLABEL XHIGHEST YLEAST YUNIT XLEAST YSECOND YUNIT XSECOND	 This graph shows that YHIGHEST YUNIT of YLABEL is caused by XHIGHEST . Only YLEAST YUNIT is caused by XLEAST whilst YSECOND YUNIT is XSECOND
PLOTTITLE XLABEL YLABEL YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT XHIGHEST YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT XSECOND YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT XLEAST	 The graph details the PLOTTITLE , detailing the XLABEL given as a YLABEL . The graph shows that YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT indicate a XHIGHEST , with YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT citing XSECOND and YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT citing XLEAST
PLOTTITLE YLABEL YHIGHEST YUNIT YLABEL T1AX XHIGHEST YSECOND YUNIT XSECOND YLEAST YUNIT XLEAST	 This chart shows PLOTTITLE by YLABEL . YHIGHEST YUNIT of YLABEL are T1AX by XHIGHEST ; YSECOND YUNIT are XSECOND and YLEAST YUNIT are due to XLEAST . Unfortunately the chart doesn't show the cases where more than one of these causes may have played an influence on why someone is obese .
PLOTTITLE XHIGHEST YHIGHEST YUNIT XLABEL XLEAST YLEAST YUNIT XLABEL XSECOND YSECOND YUNIT	 This graph highlights the PLOTTITLE . It indicates that XHIGHEST is a YHIGHEST YUNIT XLABEL whilst a XLEAST is YLEAST YUNIT of the XLABEL . XSECOND amount for YSECOND YUNIT .
