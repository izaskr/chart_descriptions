PLOTTITLE BARNAMES XHIGHEST XSECOND GRYHIGHESTSECOND YUNIT YLABEL XLEAST YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT	 Bar chart showing PLOTTITLE for BARNAMES . \\n \\n Both XHIGHEST and the XSECOND have a GRYHIGHESTSECOND YUNIT YLABEL , whereas XLEAST is YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT .
YLABEL XHIGHEST YHIGHEST YUNIT XSECOND YSECOND YUNIT XLEAST YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT	 The YLABEL in XHIGHEST is YHIGHEST YUNIT , in the XSECOND is YSECOND YUNIT and in XLEAST is YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT .
YLABEL COUNT XLABEL XHIGHEST YLABEL YHIGHEST YUNIT XSECOND ADDSECONDHIGHEST YUNIT XLEAST YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT	 The graph shows the YLABEL across COUNT XLABEL . XHIGHEST has the largest YLABEL of YHIGHEST YUNIT , followed by the XSECOND at only ADDSECONDHIGHEST YUNIT lower and then XLEAST at YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT
BARNAMES YLABEL XLABEL YLABEL XHIGHEST YHIGHEST YUNIT XSECOND YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT XLEAST ADDLEASTSECOND YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT	 This graph demonstrates the differences between BARNAMES in terms of the YLABEL in each of those XLABEL . \\n The YLABEL was the largest in XHIGHEST at YHIGHEST YUNIT with the XSECOND very close behind at YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT . \\n XLEAST is ADDLEASTSECOND % lower than this at YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT
XHIGHEST YLABEL YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT XSECOND YSECOND YUNIT XLEAST YLEAST YUNIT	 the table shows that the XHIGHEST has the biggest YLABEL ( YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT ) , followed by XSECOND ( YSECOND YUNIT ) and XLEAST ( YLEAST YUNIT ) .
XHIGHEST YLABEL YHIGHEST YUNIT XLEAST YLEAST YUNIT YLABEL XSECOND ADDSECONDHIGHEST YUNIT XHIGHEST	 Surprisingly the XHIGHEST has the largest YLABEL at YHIGHEST YUNIT while XLEAST has a mere YLEAST YUNIT YLABEL . XSECOND has ADDSECONDHIGHEST YUNIT lower than the XHIGHEST despite its poor Maternity packages .
PLOTTITLE COUNT XLABEL BARNAMES YUNIT XHIGHEST YLABEL	 This bar chart shows the PLOTTITLE in COUNT XLABEL , ; BARNAMES . It is displayed as a YUNIT , and the XHIGHEST has a higher YLABEL . However it is not clear what the percentage is of, or which gender is favoured in the pay gap from the graph labels itself .
YLABEL XHIGHEST YHIGHEST YUNIT XSECOND YSECOND YUNIT XLEAST YLABEL YLEAST YUNIT	 The YLABEL is highest in the XHIGHEST at YHIGHEST YUNIT , followed by XSECOND at YSECOND YUNIT . XLEAST has the lowest YLABEL at YLEAST YUNIT
YLABEL COUNT T0AX XLABEL T1AB XLEAST XLABEL YLABEL YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT XSECOND YLABEL COUNT XLABEL YSECOND YUNIT YLABEL XHIGHEST YLABEL XSECOND YHIGHEST YUNIT	 This chart shows the YLABEL in COUNT different T0AX XLABEL in the T1AB . \\n \\n From this chart , we can see that XLEAST was the XLABEL with the smallest YLABEL of YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT . The XSECOND has the second largest YLABEL of the COUNT XLABEL with a YSECOND YUNIT YLABEL . XHIGHEST YLABEL is the highest , but only slightly higher than the XSECOND at YHIGHEST YUNIT .
