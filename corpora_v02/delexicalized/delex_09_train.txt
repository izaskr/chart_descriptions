YHIGHEST YUNIT of T0AY in the XHIGHEST XLABEL are T0AY , compared to YSECOND YUNIT in XSECOND , YTHIRD YUNIT in XTHIRD , YFOURTH YUNIT in XFOURTH and YLEAST YUNIT in XLEAST . This may be because there is less emphasis placed on encouraging women into STEM subjects, and there are and underrepresentation of women in this area .
