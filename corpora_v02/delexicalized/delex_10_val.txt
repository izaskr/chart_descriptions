XTHIRD is just over MULTHIRDHIGHEST of those working in the XHIGHEST . XLEAST have YLEAST YUNIT , which is MULLEASTSECOND of those working in XSECOND and MULLEASTHIGHEST of those in XHIGHEST .
XHIGHEST YHIGHEST YUNIT T1AY XSECOND YSECOND YUNIT T1AY XTHIRD XLEAST T1AY YTHIRD YUNIT YLEAST YUNIT T1AY	 XHIGHEST are made up of YHIGHEST YUNIT T1AY and XSECOND are made up of YSECOND YUNIT T1AY . XTHIRD and XLEAST are only T1AY by YTHIRD YUNIT and YLEAST YUNIT of T1AY respectively .

YLABEL PLOTTITLE YLABEL XHIGHEST YHIGHEST YUNIT YLABEL XLEAST YLEAST YUNIT XTHIRD YTHIRD YUNIT XSECOND YUNIT YLABEL XHIGHEST XLEAST	 This chart shows the YLABEL of PLOTTITLE . \\n \\n From the chart we see that highest YLABEL are in the XHIGHEST at YHIGHEST YUNIT . \\n \\n The lowest YLABEL is in XLEAST at YLEAST YUNIT followed behind by XTHIRD at YTHIRD YUNIT and then not far behind by XSECOND . \\n \\n There is a large YUNIT difference in YLABEL between XHIGHEST and XLEAST .
XLABEL YLABEL XHIGHEST XLEAST YLEAST YUNIT T1AY XLABEL XTHIRD YTHIRD YLABEL XSECOND YSECONDAPPROX	 The chart shows that the XLABEL with most YLABEL is XHIGHEST . however XLEAST is the least with less than YLEAST YUNIT of T1AY in the XLABEL . XTHIRD has only a YTHIRD of YLABEL with XSECOND a little over YSECONDAPPROX .
