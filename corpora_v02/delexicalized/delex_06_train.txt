YHIGHEST YUNIT T1AY XHIGHEST YSECOND YUNIT XSECOND XTHIRD XSECOND YLABEL YTHIRD YUNIT GRLEASTLEAST GRYLEASTLEAST YUNIT	 YHIGHEST YUNIT of the T1AY are in XHIGHEST , followed by YSECOND YUNIT in XSECOND . XTHIRD is close to the XSECOND YLABEL at YTHIRD YUNIT . GRLEASTLEAST are similarly low at about GRYLEASTLEAST YUNIT .
PLOTTITLE XHIGHEST YHIGHEST XSECOND YSECOND XTHIRD YTHIRD GRLEASTLEAST GRYLEASTLEAST	 this graph shows the PLOTTITLE leading is XHIGHEST with YHIGHEST , XSECOND with YSECOND , XTHIRD with YTHIRD and GRLEASTLEAST tying with GRYLEASTLEAST each . this shows that america and europe combined have more than 80% of the top 100 universities
YHIGHEST T1AY YLABEL XHIGHEST YSECOND YUNIT XSECOND XTHIRD XLEAST XLEAST XTHIRD YTHIRD YUNIT GRLEASTLEAST GRYLEASTLEAST YUNIT	 YHIGHEST of the T1AY YLABEL in the world are in XHIGHEST . YSECOND YUNIT are in XSECOND . XTHIRD , XLEAST and XLEAST have fewer . XTHIRD with YTHIRD YUNIT and GRLEASTLEAST both with GRYLEASTLEAST YUNIT . This would show that those with the highest quality university education study in the US or Europe .
PLOTTITLE BARNAMES XHIGHEST YLABEL T1AY GRLEASTLEAST XSECOND YSECOND T1AY XTHIRD YTHIRD	 The graph highlights the PLOTTITLE , namely , BARNAMES . It shows that XHIGHEST has the highest YLABEL of T1AY with GRLEASTLEAST having equally the least . XSECOND had YSECOND of the T1AY and XTHIRD has YTHIRD .
YHIGHEST YUNIT T1AY YLABEL XHIGHEST YSECOND YUNIT XSECOND YTHIRD YUNIT XTHIRD GRYLEASTLEAST YUNIT GRLEASTLEAST	 This graph shows that YHIGHEST YUNIT of the T1AY YLABEL are in XHIGHEST , YSECOND YUNIT in XSECOND , YTHIRD YUNIT in XTHIRD with GRYLEASTLEAST YUNIT in both GRLEASTLEAST .
YHIGHEST T1AY YLABEL XHIGHEST YSECOND YUNIT XSECOND XTHIRD YTHIRD YUNIT T1AY YLABEL GRLEASTLEAST YUNIT GRYLEASTLEAST YUNIT	 YHIGHEST of the worlds T1AY YLABEL are XHIGHEST , followed by YSECOND YUNIT being XSECOND . XTHIRD contributes YTHIRD YUNIT of the T1AY YLABEL and GRLEASTLEAST contribute the lowest YUNIT with just GRYLEASTLEAST YUNIT each .
PLOTTITLE XHIGHEST YUNIT YHIGHEST XSECOND YSECOND XTHIRD YTHIRD GRLEASTLEAST GRYLEASTLEAST	 This graph shows the PLOTTITLE . XHIGHEST has the highest YUNIT with YHIGHEST , XSECOND is next with YSECOND , XTHIRD follows with YTHIRD and then GRLEASTLEAST have GRYLEASTLEAST each .
PLOTTITLE XHIGHEST YHIGHEST XSECOND YSECOND XTHIRD YTHIRD GRLEASTLEAST GRYLEASTLEAST	 The graph shows the PLOTTITLE . XHIGHEST has the most at YHIGHEST , XSECOND second with YSECOND , then XTHIRD with YTHIRD and GRLEASTLEAST are joint last with GRYLEASTLEAST each .
XHIGHEST YLABEL T1AY YHIGHEST XHIGHEST XSECOND YSECOND YUNIT T1AY YLABEL XTHIRD YTHIRD GRLEASTLEAST GRYLEASTLEAST YLABEL T1AY	 The chart shows that XHIGHEST has the highest YLABEL of T1AY with YHIGHEST being on XHIGHEST . XSECOND holds YSECOND YUNIT of the T1AY YLABEL , followed by XTHIRD with YTHIRD . GRLEASTLEAST both have GRYLEASTLEAST YLABEL in the T1AY
XHIGHEST T1AY YLABEL YHIGHEST XSECOND YSECOND XTHIRD YTHIRD GRLEASTLEAST GRYLEASTLEAST	 the table shows that XHIGHEST has the most T1AY YLABEL ( YHIGHEST ) , followed by XSECOND ( YSECOND ) , XTHIRD ( YTHIRD ) , GRLEASTLEAST draw with about GRYLEASTLEAST each .
PLOTTITLE YHIGHEST XHIGHEST XSECOND YSECOND YUNIT XTHIRD YTHIRD YUNIT GRLEASTLEAST GRYLEASTLEAST YUNIT	 This graph shows PLOTTITLE . YHIGHEST of them are in XHIGHEST . XSECOND comes next with YSECOND YUNIT , followed by XTHIRD with YTHIRD YUNIT . GRLEASTLEAST ( the country ) have GRYLEASTLEAST YUNIT each .
PLOTTITLE XHIGHEST YHIGHEST YUNIT T1AY YLABEL T1AY YSECOND YUNIT XSECOND XTHIRD YTHIRD YUNIT GRLEASTLEAST GRYLEASTLEAST YUNIT	 This graph shows the PLOTTITLE . XHIGHEST shows the highest at YHIGHEST YUNIT of T1AY YLABEL . This is followed by the next T1AY being at YSECOND YUNIT in XSECOND . XTHIRD comes in at YTHIRD YUNIT and GRLEASTLEAST come in equally at GRYLEASTLEAST YUNIT each .
PLOTTITLE XHIGHEST T1AY YHIGHEST XSECOND YSECOND XTHIRD YTHIRD GRLEASTLEAST YLABEL T1AY GRYLEASTLEAST	 This chart shows the PLOTTITLE . XHIGHEST has the most T1AY at YHIGHEST , while XSECOND is 2nd at YSECOND and XTHIRD 3rd at YTHIRD . GRLEASTLEAST have the lowest YLABEL in the T1AY at GRYLEASTLEAST each . This could be interpreted as there being better education in America, however the data could also be inaccurate, as the Top 100 Universities list is made by an American company, therefore may be bias towards American institutions .
PLOTTITLE XHIGHEST YHIGHEST YLABEL XSECOND YSECOND XTHIRD YTHIRD GRLEASTLEAST GRYLEASTLEAST	 This chart shows the PLOTTITLE . XHIGHEST leads the way with YHIGHEST YLABEL , then XSECOND with YSECOND , XTHIRD with YTHIRD and both GRLEASTLEAST with GRYLEASTLEAST
T1AY YLABEL XHIGHEST BARSREST	 There are more T1AY YLABEL in XHIGHEST than BARSREST in the world .
XHIGHEST YLABEL T1AY XSECOND	 XHIGHEST has the highest YLABEL of T1AY followed by XSECOND
PLOTTITLE YHIGHEST XHIGHEST YSECOND XSECOND YTHIRD XTHIRD GRLEASTLEAST GRYLEASTLEAST T1AY	 This chart shows the PLOTTITLE . There are YHIGHEST in the XHIGHEST , YSECOND in XSECOND and YTHIRD in XTHIRD . GRLEASTLEAST show as having GRYLEASTLEAST of the T1AY each
PLOTTITLE XHIGHEST YHIGHEST T1AY YLABEL XLEAST YLEASTAPPROX	 This graph displays the PLOTTITLE . The data presumably comes from a ranking source but this information is not provided . XHIGHEST has YHIGHEST the T1AY YLABEL , while XLEAST only has YLEASTAPPROX .
