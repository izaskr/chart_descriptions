YHIGHEST YUNIT has during each surveyed period in the with the period XHIGHEST being the level at YHIGHEST YUNIT
This chart looks at by looking at the YLABEL of YLABEL during INTERVAL XLABEL periods . The overall is an in YLABEL 1990 to 2019 . During the period XLEAST there was YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT YLABEL . This had ADDFIFTHLEAST fold to YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT in XFIFTH . There was a in XFOURTH where to YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT . XTHIRD saw YTHIRD YUNIT . The YLABEL figure again to YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT in XSECOND . The figure to YHIGHEST YUNIT in the period XHIGHEST .
The graph depicts the by way of detaling what YLABEL of were . The YLABEL has since the time the graph began in 1990 . It has from YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT XLEAST , to YHIGHEST YUNIT in XHIGHEST . During each INTERVAL XLABEL period the have .
This chart shows how the YLABEL of in the has changed . YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT It shows that XLEAST there was a YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT which . XFIFTH YUNIT YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT the was at YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT , XFOURTH it was YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT , XTHIRD it was YTHIRD YUNIT , XSECOND it was YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT and XHIGHEST was at its at YHIGHEST YUNIT .
The chart shows the . The YLABEL of YLABEL has since XLEAST until recently , XHIGHEST . YHIGHEST YUNIT YLEASTAPPROX ADDHIGHESTLEAST YUNIT YUNIT of YLABEL in the XLABEL XLEAST , til YHIGHEST YUNIT in XHIGHEST , there has been an overall of ADDHIGHESTLEAST YUNIT .
This graph shows that has . XLEAST YLABEL , there was a YLABEL . XFIFTH YFIFTHAPPROX , the YLABEL to YFIFTHAPPROX . XFOURTH , the YLABEL to . In XTHIRD , the YLABEL to YTHIRD . By XSECOND , this to and again in XHIGHEST to YHIGHEST .
The chart shows the rate of within the based on the YLABEL of groups represented a number of XLABEL . XEND has been since XSTART and until the recorded date of XEND . In XLEAST the rate was YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT and remained YTHIRD YUNIT until XSECOND after which it to numbers and was reported to be YHIGHEST YUNIT in XHIGHEST .
The YLEAST YUNIT had the YLABEL in XHIGHEST with YHIGHEST YUNIT and the in XLEAST with YLEAST YUNIT . It YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT YTHIRD YUNIT in XFIFTH with YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT and again each XLABEL XFOURTH with YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT , XTHIRD with YTHIRD YUNIT and XSECOND with YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT .
The has become increasingly since 1990 , when MULSECONDHIGHEST YUNIT of were . This YTHIRD YUNIT to YFIFTHAPPROX YHIGHEST YUNIT YUNIT by the XFIFTH period , MULFOURTHFIFTH to YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT in XFOURTH , to YTHIRD YUNIT by 2005 and YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT by 2010 , and reached a of YHIGHEST YUNIT in the XHIGHEST period .
The chart shows the YLABEL of in the in INTERVAL XLABEL chunks INTERVAL . XLABEL The figures give a for each category of XLABEL . The took place INTERVAL at and INTERVAL MULFOURTHFIFTH on the previous period . This rate of change slowed down to YUNIT INTERVAL and this was repeated with the XSECOND and the bar MULHIGHESTLEAST YUNIT .
This chart shows the YLABEL of YLABEL within the . XLABEL YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT From the chart we see that during the XLABEL of XLEAST YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT of the were by . YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT YFOURTHAPPROX During the XLABEL YHIGHEST YUNIT XFIFTH this to YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT , and to to YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT during XFOURTH , to YTHIRD YUNIT during XTHIRD , to YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT during XSECOND and ti YHIGHEST YUNIT during XHIGHEST .
As can be seen in the graph YLABEL is improves every SLOPEX XLABEL . With the in the most recent period of XHIGHEST at YHIGHEST YUNIT . The was the earliest period on the graph , XLEAST with YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT . YUNIT YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT XFIFTH - XSECOND YLABEL improves YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT to YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT .
