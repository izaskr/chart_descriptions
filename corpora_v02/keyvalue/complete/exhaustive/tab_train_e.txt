We can see that since 1990 , minority representation has increased . With a percentage of less than 1 % in the years 1990 - 1994 , this was seen to double to 2 % between 1995 - 1999 . At the turn of the millennium to 2004 , we see the biggest increase from 2 % to just over 7 % . Diversity has continued to increase around 2 - 4 % every four years , where we can see the most recent stats standing at 14 % minority representation in the years between 2015 - 2019 .
