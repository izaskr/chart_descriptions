We have data recorded in YUNIT rather number of and results are split into responses for COUNT XLABEL ; XLABEL XSECOND , XFOURTH , XLEAST , XHIGHEST and XTHIRD . The scale for YUNIT is a difficult to read with any accuracy due to the way it has been segmented a rough idea of results can be found . Careful reading of the data shows that both the XLABEL GRFOURTHLEAST recorded the same and overall number of YLABEL at GRYFOURTHLEAST YUNIT each . The XLABEL XHIGHEST recorded the number of YLABEL at YHIGHEST per .
