We have data recorded in minutes rather than number of uses and results are split into responses for five age range groups ; ages 15-24 , 25-34 , 35-44 , 45-54 and 55-64 . The scale for minutes is a little difficult to read with any accuracy due to the way it has been segmented but a rough idea of results can be found . Careful reading of the data shows that both the age group 25-34 and 35-44 recorded the same and overall lowest number of minutes at around 70 minutes each . The age group 45-54 recorded the highest number of minutes at around 150 per day .

The title and graphic representation are a little at odds , as the teams with the tallest bars were actually the least successful . Additionally the scale for the number of mistakes is hard to read with any precision as it suggests incorrect answers could be part of a whole number . Careful reading of the data shows that team Lovely made more than 8 mistakes but less than 10 and were therefore the least successful team in the quiz competition . The most successful team , team Fearless made less than 2 mistakes . Teams DIY and Cats made between 2 and 4 mistakes and teams ABC and Smart kids made between 4 and 6 mistakes .
