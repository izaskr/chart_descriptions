This chart shows PLOTTITLE INTERVAL . YUNIT YHIGHEST YUNIT , the YLABEL has YUNIT XLEAST to YHIGHEST YUNIT XHIGHEST .
The graph depicts the PLOTTITLE by way of detaling what YLABEL of were . The YLABEL has since the time the graph began in 1990 . It has from YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT XLEAST , to YHIGHEST YUNIT in XHIGHEST . During each INTERVAL XLABEL period the have .
The chart shows the YLABEL of YLABEL in the , which has been since 1990 . In the period XLEAST YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT of the were from a . XFIFTH YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT this had to YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT , and by XFOURTH , this had reached YUNIT . This YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT to YHIGHEST YUNIT in subsequent , with the XTHIRD sitting having YTHIRD YUNIT YLABEL , the XSECOND reaching YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT , and in XHIGHEST reaching a of YHIGHEST YUNIT .
in the has from 1990 to the day with YLABEL from YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT to YHIGHEST YUNIT currently . The YUNIT YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT rate of growth in this area happened in the early noughties which saw an from YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT to YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT by 2004 .
The chart shows the YLABEL of in the in INTERVAL XLABEL chunks INTERVAL . XLABEL The figures give a for each category of XLABEL . The took place INTERVAL at and INTERVAL MULFOURTHFIFTH on the previous period . This rate of change slowed down to YUNIT INTERVAL and this was repeated with the XSECOND and the bar MULHIGHESTLEAST YUNIT .
This graph is showing the YLABEL of in the . YUNIT YLABEL was at an XLEAST with YUNIT YLABEL ; XFIFTH YLABEL to YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT . XFOURTH YUNIT , MULFOURTHFIFTH to YUNIT . The YLABEL growth YUNIT XTHIRD , only by YUNIT , to YTHIRD YUNIT growth , and again XSECOND , the YLABEL by ADDTHIRDSECOND YUNIT to YUNIT . In recent XLABEL XHIGHEST , has had the YLABEL growth to YHIGHEST YUNIT , with ADDHIGHESTSECOND YUNIT growth .
This chart shows the YLABEL of YLABEL within the . XLABEL YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT From the chart we see that during the XLABEL of XLEAST YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT of the were by . YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT YFOURTHAPPROX During the XLABEL YHIGHEST YUNIT XFIFTH this to YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT , and to to YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT during XFOURTH , to YTHIRD YUNIT during XTHIRD , to YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT during XSECOND and ti YHIGHEST YUNIT during XHIGHEST .
The YLEAST YUNIT had the YLABEL in XHIGHEST with YHIGHEST YUNIT and the in XLEAST with YLEAST YUNIT . It YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT YTHIRD YUNIT in XFIFTH with YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT and again each XLABEL XFOURTH with YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT , XTHIRD with YTHIRD YUNIT and XSECOND with YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT .
The has become increasingly since 1990 , when MULSECONDHIGHEST YUNIT of were . This YTHIRD YUNIT to YFIFTHAPPROX YHIGHEST YUNIT YUNIT by the XFIFTH period , MULFOURTHFIFTH to YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT in XFOURTH , to YTHIRD YUNIT by 2005 and YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT by 2010 , and reached a of YHIGHEST YUNIT in the XHIGHEST period .
This graph displays PLOTTITLE by YLABEL as a YLABEL of different XLABEL brackets . In XLEAST , YLABEL was at its ( YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT ) . In XFIFTH , YLABEL to YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT . YLABEL YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT further in XFOURTH to YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT . In XTHIRD , YLABEL was at YTHIRD YUNIT . In XSECOND , YLABEL further to YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT . In XHIGHEST , YLABEL reached YHIGHEST YUNIT . Therefore , this graph shows an of YLABEL INTERVAL .
The graph illustrates the in the 1990 to 2019 . The is measured by the YLABEL of . The graph illustrates that in 1990 there was YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT YLABEL . By 1999 this had to YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT and by 2004 it had to YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT . SLOPEY YUNIT SLOPEX XLABEL 2005 to 2019 there was a in at SLOPEY YUNIT every SLOPEX XLABEL . YHIGHEST YUNIT by in the now stands at YHIGHEST YUNIT . ( XHIGHEST )
The YUNIT YLABEL in the was in XLEAST where it had YUNIT YLABEL . It to YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT INTERVAL XLABEL later in XFOURTH and to YHIGHEST YUNIT by XHIGHEST .
The chart shows the rate of within the based on the YLABEL of groups represented a number of XLABEL . XEND has been since XSTART and until the recorded date of XEND . In XLEAST the rate was YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT and remained YTHIRD YUNIT until XSECOND after which it to numbers and was reported to be YHIGHEST YUNIT in XHIGHEST .
This chart looks at PLOTTITLE by looking at the YLABEL of YLABEL during INTERVAL XLABEL periods . The overall is an in YLABEL 1990 to 2019 . During the period XLEAST there was YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT YLABEL . This had ADDFIFTHLEAST fold to YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT in XFIFTH . There was a in XFOURTH where to YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT . XTHIRD saw YTHIRD YUNIT . The YLABEL figure again to YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT in XSECOND . The figure to YHIGHEST YUNIT in the period XHIGHEST .
The chart shows the PLOTTITLE . The YLABEL of YLABEL has since XLEAST until recently , XHIGHEST . YHIGHEST YUNIT YLEASTAPPROX ADDHIGHESTLEAST YUNIT YUNIT of YLABEL in the XLABEL XLEAST , til YHIGHEST YUNIT in XHIGHEST , there has been an overall of ADDHIGHESTLEAST YUNIT .
This chart shows how in has changed , 1990 , to 2019 . We can see that since 1990 , YLABEL has . With a YLABEL of YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT in the XLABEL XLEAST , this was seen to to YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT XFIFTH . At the turn of the millennium to 2004 , we see the YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT to YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT . YUNIT SLOPEX XLABEL has XLABEL to SLOPEY - SLOPEY YUNIT every SLOPEX XLABEL , where we can see the recent stats standing at YHIGHEST YUNIT YLABEL in the XLABEL XHIGHEST .
This graph shows that has . XLEAST YLABEL , there was a YLABEL . XFIFTH YFIFTHAPPROX , the YLABEL to YFIFTHAPPROX . XFOURTH , the YLABEL to . In XTHIRD , the YLABEL to YTHIRD . By XSECOND , this to and again in XHIGHEST to YHIGHEST .
This chart shows how the YLABEL in the has . In XLEAST , the YLABEL was almost trivial , at YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT . In the following INTERVAL XLABEL , it twentyfold , to YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT . In the following INTERVAL - XLABEL periods , it initially to YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT , to YTHIRD YUNIT and YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT . In the recent period for which data is available , it stands at YHIGHEST YUNIT .
INTERVAL XLABEL YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT YHIGHEST in the XHIGHEST has in the last INTERVAL XLABEL YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT to YHIGHEST YUNIT The occurred from XSTART - XEND by MULFOURTHFIFTH 2004 onwards until its in XHIGHEST
This chart shows how the YLABEL of in the has changed . YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT It shows that XLEAST there was a YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT which . XFIFTH YUNIT YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT the was at YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT , XFOURTH it was YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT , XTHIRD it was YTHIRD YUNIT , XSECOND it was YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT and XHIGHEST was at its at YHIGHEST YUNIT .
As can be seen in the graph YLABEL is improves every SLOPEX XLABEL . With the in the most recent period of XHIGHEST at YHIGHEST YUNIT . The was the earliest period on the graph , XLEAST with YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT . YUNIT YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT XFIFTH - XSECOND YLABEL improves YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT to YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT .
This bar chart shows the in the by YLABEL as a YLABEL by the XLABEL . In XLEAST YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT , it was the at YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT MULSECONDHIGHEST that at YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT in XFIFTH . The XLABEL XFOURTH showed YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT . XLABEL XLABEL XLABEL XTHIRD YHIGHEST YUNIT showed 10 % , then by the in the XLABEL XSECOND at 12.8%.The was in XLABEL XHIGHEST at YHIGHEST YUNIT .
YHIGHEST YUNIT has during each surveyed period in the with the period XHIGHEST being the level at YHIGHEST YUNIT
