This chart shows PLOTTITLE . XHIGHEST YSECOND YHIGHEST From the chart we see that the XSECOND and XHIGHEST ( with YSECOND and YHIGHEST visits respectively , for a total of ) were often the remaining 4 XLABEL put together ( with a combined total of ) .
This grpah sowns PLOTTITLE . The XHIGHEST bar on this chart show that . YUNIT XLABEL YHIGHESTAPPROX YMAG YUNIT is , being the of all XLABEL show by this data .
This chart shows PLOTTITLE . The XLABEL is XLEAST with a YLABEL of YLEAST YUNIT . XFIFTH is the at YFIFTH YUNIT . at YFOURTH YUNIT is XFOURTH . XTHIRD has a YLABEL of YTHIRD YUNIT . The XLABEL on the chart is XSECOND with YLABEL of YSECOND YUNIT . There is then a of ADDHIGHESTSECOND YUNIT to the XLABEL on the chart which is XHIGHEST at YHIGHEST YUNIT .
This chart shows the PLOTTITLE . XSECOND From the chart we see that the XHIGHEST YLABEL is comparable to the XSECOND one ( with both at GRYHIGHESTSECOND YUNIT ) , and MULSECONDLEAST YUNIT than the XLEAST ( which sits at YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT ) .
This bar chart is a PLOTTITLE XSTART XHIGHEST XEND XFIFTH . INTERVAL XFIFTH In XHIGHEST it was at its , which every INTERVAL XLABEL it until XFIFTH . XFIFTH for the first time it again gaining a YLABEL .
This chart shows how much YLABEL was spent on by each of the COUNT XLABEL in the . YMAG XHIGHEST spent the at YUNIT YHIGHESTAPPROX YMAG . XSECOND YMAG comes in line with spending YUNIT YSECONDAPPROX YMAG . XTHIRD spent YUNIT YTHIRDAPPROX YMAG in . XLEAST YLEASTAPPROX YMAG spent the with YUNIT YLEASTAPPROX YMAG .
This graph measures the YLABEL at over a INTERVAL XLABEL period . YLABEL YHIGHEST XHIGHEST YLEAST XLEAST It shows that there was a in YLABEL from YHIGHEST YUNIT in XHIGHEST to YLEAST YUNIT in XLEAST .
XHIGHEST YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT is the XLABEL in at YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT . XSECOND YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT at YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT and XLEAST is the XLABEL in at YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT .
this chart shows PLOTTITLE . GRHIGHESTSECOND GRYHIGHESTSECOND YUNIT XLEAST YLEAST are the XLABEL at GRYHIGHESTSECOND YUNIT , XLEAST the at YLEAST YUNIT .
The graph shows the PLOTTITLE . YUNIT The YLABEL was XHIGHEST at YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT . The YLABEL XSECOND was YSECOND YUNIT . XTHIRD YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT XLEAST YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT it was YTHIRDAPPROX YUNIT , XFOURTH it was YFOURTHAPPROX YUNIT , XLEAST saw a YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT YLABEL and this to YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT XFIFTH
This chart describes , measured through the YLABEL , in COUNT XLABEL . It demonstrates that XLEAST has the rate of , with YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT discrepancy , XHIGHEST and the XSECOND , where there is a YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT discrepancy . XHIGHEST XLEAST and the XSECOND are therefore unequal XLEAST , judged by the YLABEL
This graph shows PLOTTITLE . YHIGHEST YTHIRD YUNIT YUNIT YLEAST YUNIT of them XHIGHEST , YSECOND YUNIT XSECOND , YTHIRD YUNIT XTHIRD , and YLEAST YUNIT XLEAST .

This chart shows the PLOTTITLE . XHIGHEST XLABEL YHIGHEST YUNIT XLABEL From the chart , we can see that XHIGHEST is the XLABEL with the YLABEL , with YHIGHEST YUNIT of the XLABEL being . XSECOND with YSECOND YUNIT of the XLABEL being , although this is a big from XHIGHEST . XTHIRD follows with YTHIRD YUNIT . XFOURTH XLABEL YFOURTH YUNIT XLEAST YLEASTAPPROX However , after this , there is a big with the XFOURTH XLABEL containing YFOURTH YUNIT of and XLEAST coming with YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT of .
Here is a graph from the for different XLABEL that have spent YLABEL on . The XLABEL is XHIGHEST which beats XSECOND at . GRHIGHESTSECOND are in the running to each other . The is XTHIRD which to XSECOND , then XLEAST which spent the on in .
The YLABEL was investigated in BARNAMES in . it was found that XHIGHEST had the YLABEL at YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT and XLEAST the at YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT .
The YLABEL in the has seen a . It started up XHIGHEST at YHIGHESTAPPROX YUNIT and to its point XLEAST at YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT where it began to again XFIFTH .

This chart represents the YLABEL to certain XLABEL at . XSECOND XHIGHEST XLABEL , but it indicates that XSECOND and XHIGHEST are the XLABEL .
As can be seen in the graph YLABEL is improves every SLOPEX XLABEL . With the in the most recent period of XHIGHEST at YHIGHEST YUNIT . The was the earliest period on the graph , XLEAST with YLEASTAPPROX YUNIT . YUNIT YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT XFIFTH - XSECOND YLABEL improves YFIFTHAPPROX YUNIT to YSECONDAPPROX YUNIT .
The chart represents what PLOTTITLE are and the bar chart shows the following COUNT XLABEL . The XLABEL is due to the XHIGHEST . This contributes to YHIGHEST YUNIT of the XLABEL . This is by XSECOND at YSECOND YUNIT and a XLEAST at YLEAST YUNIT .
This chart shows the PLOTTITLE . YTHIRD YUNIT YLABEL From the chart we see that the the of XLEAST provide at YTHIRD YUNIT YLABEL ( with XTHIRD at parity with YTHIRD YUNIT , and both XSECOND and XHIGHEST exceeding this , at YSECOND and YHIGHEST YUNIT respectively . XLEAST YLEAST YUNIT have some catching up to do , with a figure of YLEAST YUNIT .
