YLABEL[young people], XHIGHEST[reading a book], YHIGHEST[38], YUNIT[%], XLABEL[way], XLEAST[watching TV], YLEAST[12]	The majority of YLABEL in Zarqa spend their evenings XHIGHEST , at YHIGHEST YUNIT . The least popular XLABEL to spend the evening is by XLEAST , at YLEAST YUNIT .
PLOTTITLE[average annual salary for software engineers relative to their degree], XLEAST[no degree], YLABEL[salary], XTHIRD[bachelors], XLABEL[degree], XSECOND[Masters], XHIGHEST[PHD]	This chart shows the PLOTTITLE . We can see that those who have XLEAST have a lower YLABEL than those who have a XTHIRD XLABEL . Those with a XSECOND or a XHIGHEST on average earn much more .
XHIGHEST[PhD], XLABEL[degree], ADDHIGHESTTHIRD[20], YMAG[000], XLEAST[no degrees], XTHIRD[bachelor], XSECOND[Masters], ADDSECONDHIGHEST[15], YLABEL[salaries]	The chart shows that with a XHIGHEST XLABEL Software engineers earn the highest with over ADDHIGHESTTHIRD YMAG more than XLEAST and XTHIRD . XSECOND is only ADDSECONDHIGHEST YMAG behind XHIGHEST but shows more XLABEL are needed for higher YLABEL .
XHIGHEST[PHD], YLABEL[salary], BARSREST[those who do not]	Those who have a XHIGHEST do better in terms of YLABEL than BARSREST
YLABEL[engineers' salaries], XTHIRD[Bachelor], XSECOND[Master], XLEAST[PhD], ADDLEASTTHIRD[10], YMAG[,000]	There is an equal increase between YLABEL from XTHIRD through XSECOND to XLEAST . Engineers with XLEAST were worse off than XTHIRD ' s YLABEL by approximately ADDLEASTTHIRD YMAG .

Those with XLEAST are the lowest at YLEAST YMAG , those with a XTHIRD XLABEL come in at YTHIRD YMAG . With a XSECOND XLABEL , the engineers median YLABEL is at YSECOND YMAG and finally , those with a XHIGHEST are at the highest level of YHIGHEST YMAG .
XHIGHEST[PhDs], BARSREST[counterparts], YLABEL[salaries], XLEAST[no degree], XTHIRD[bachelors], XLABEL[degree], XSECOND[masters]	This shows that Software Engineers with XHIGHEST earn more than their BARSREST . The lowest YLABEL are to those who have XLEAST , followed by a XTHIRD XLABEL then a XSECOND XLABEL - therefore we can take from this graph that the higher the level of education , the higher the YLABEL Software Engineers earn per year

XSECOND XLABEL graduates come 2nd earning on average YUNIT YSECOND YMAG . Then comes XTHIRD XLABEL graduates , earning YUNIT YTHIRD YMAG on average . Finally those with XLEAST earn the least , earning just over YUNIT YLEASTAPPROX YMAG on average .
PLOTTITLE[average median salary per year for software engineers with respect to their degree type], XLEAST[no degree], XHIGHEST[PhD], YUNIT[$], ADDHIGHESTLEAST[30], YMAG[,000]	This charts shows the PLOTTITLE . Not surprisingly , those with XLEAST earn the least ; and those with a XHIGHEST earn the most . There is a difference of about YUNIT ADDHIGHESTLEAST YMAG between these average earnings .
YLABEL[salary], XLEAST[no degree], MULLEASTHIGHEST[half], XHIGHEST[PHd]	This graph shows a trend that the higher the qualifications held by software engineer , the greater the YLABEL they receive . Those with XLEAST receive almost MULLEASTHIGHEST of the YLABEL received by those with a XHIGHEST . Education increases earning potential .

We can see that there is an approximately YUNIT ADDHIGHESTTHIRD YMAG YLABEL difference between those with a XTHIRD XLABEL and those with a XHIGHEST but only an approximate YUNIT ADDTHIRDLEAST YMAG difference between those with a XTHIRD and those XLEAST .
XHIGHEST[PhD], XLABEL[degree], YLABEL[money], BARSREST[lesser degrees]	This chart shows that software engineers who have a XHIGHEST XLABEL earn more YLABEL than software engineers with BARSREST . The chart demonstrates that the higher the degree , the more YLABEL earned on average .
