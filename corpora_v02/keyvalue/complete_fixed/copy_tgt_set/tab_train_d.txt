We have data recorded in YUNIT rather than number of uses and results are split into responses for COUNT XLABEL ; XLABEL XSECOND , XFOURTH , XLEAST , XHIGHEST and XTHIRD . The scale for YUNIT is a little difficult to read with any accuracy due to the way it has been segmented but a rough idea of results can be found . Careful reading of the data shows that both the XLABEL GRFOURTHLEAST recorded the same and overall lowest number of YLABEL at around GRYFOURTHLEAST YUNIT each . The XLABEL XHIGHEST recorded the highest number of YLABEL at around YHIGHEST per day .
