The title and graphic representation are a little at odds , as the XLABEL with the tallest bars were actually the least successful . Additionally the scale for the number of mistakes is hard to read with any precision as it suggests incorrect answers could be part of a whole number . Careful reading of the data shows that XLABEL XHIGHEST made more than YHIGHESTAPPROX YLABEL but less than YHIGHESTAPPROX and were therefore the least successful XLABEL in the quiz competition . The most successful XLABEL , XLABEL XLEAST made less than YLEASTAPPROX YLABEL . XLABEL XFOURTH and XFIFTH made between YFIFTHAPPROX and YFOURTH YLABEL and XLABEL XTHIRD and XSECOND made between YTHIRDAPPROX and YSECOND YLABEL .
