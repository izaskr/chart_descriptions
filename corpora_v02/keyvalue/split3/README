Split 3:
the train+val contain topics, which are not included in the test. The idea is to test on unseen data

Train IDs: 
	{'07_01', '10_02', '02_02', '10_01', '09_01', '08_02', '03_02', '11_01', '03_01', '01_02', '14_01', '14_02', '07_02', '02_01', '11_02', '01_01', '09_02', '08_01', '06_01'} 

Test IDs: 
	{'12_01', '05_02', '12_02', '05_01', '13_01', '04_01', '13_02'}
